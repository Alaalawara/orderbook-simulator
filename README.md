git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/orderbook-simulator.git
cd orderbook-simulator
npm install
Running Locally
bash
npm run dev
# Or, if using yarn

View Orderbook:

15 levels of bids/asks are displayed.

Depth chart below visualizes aggregated liquidity.

Simulate Order:

Choose order type (market/limit), side (buy/sell), price (if limit), and quantity.

Choose "timing/delay" for order (immediate or delayed).

Hit "Simulate":

Your order will be highlighted in the live orderbook table, with fill, impact, and slippage metrics.

All views update in real-time.

Order Simulation Documentation
Fields
Field	Description
Venue	OKX, Bybit, Deribit
Symbol	Example: BTC-USDT, BTCUSDT, ETH-PERPETUAL
Order Type	Market: matches best price, Limit: specify price
Side	Buy/Sell
Price	Required for limit orders
Quantity	Order size in asset units
Delay	Simulate order after delay (0/5s/10s/30s)
Metrics Shown
Estimated Fill: Quantity and percentage likely filled based on current orderbook.

Market Impact: Estimated price movement (in %) if order sweeps orderbook levels (for market orders).

Slippage: Difference between expected price (limit/market) and actually filled weighted average price (WAP).

Order Position Highlight: Clearly marks where your order would be in the live orderbook.

Market Depth and Bonus Features
Market Depth Chart:
Shows cumulative bid/ask volumes across price levels.

Orderbook Imbalance (optional):
Indicates when one side (bid/ask) dominates liquidity.

Slippage Warnings:
If your simulated order size is much larger than available liquidity, you'll get a visual warning.

API Documentation & Rate Limits
APIs Used
OKX Spot, Futures Orderbook:

OKX API docs

wss://ws.okx.com:8443/ws/v5/public (no API key needed)

Rate limits: ~20 req/min, no aggressive reconnect

Bybit Spot Orderbook:

Bybit API docs

wss://stream.bybit.com/v5/public/spot

Rate limits: Documented in Bybit docs

Deribit Perpetual/Futures Orderbook:

Deribit API docs

wss://www.deribit.com/ws/api/v2/

Public orderbook channel; 20 levels used, client slices to 15.

Considerations
All services use public WebSocket endpointsâ€”no authentication required.

Handles API throttling/failures:
If a WebSocket closes or errors, the app attempts to recover gracefully with minimal reconnect attempts.

For slower/failing connections, app displays stale data indicators.
